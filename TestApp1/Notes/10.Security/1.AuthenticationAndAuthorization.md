# Authentication and Authorization in ASP.NET MVC

## üîê What Are Authentication and Authorization?

| Concept        | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Authentication** | Confirms the **identity** of the user (e.g., username/password check) |
| **Authorization**  | Determines whether an authenticated user has **access rights** to a specific resource |

> Authentication **must happen first**. Authorization comes afterward.

## ‚úÖ What is Authentication?

Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity against a **trusted data source** (like a database or Active Directory).

### Real-World Analogy:

Imagine an IT company with multiple sections:
- Reception
- HR
- Accounts
- Server Room

At the **entry gate**, a **biometric system** validates employee credentials. Only **valid employees** are allowed to enter the premises.

This process is called **Authentication**.

## üîí What is Authorization?

Authorization determines **what an authenticated user is allowed to do**.

### Continuing the Analogy:

After a user enters the campus:
- Their **role** decides which sections they can access.
- HR staff can access the HR section, but not the Server Room.
- Admins may have access to all areas.

This **access control** process is **Authorization**.

## üîÅ Types of Authentication in ASP.NET MVC

ASP.NET MVC supports the following authentication types:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Forms Authentication** | User credentials are submitted through a **login form** |
| **Windows Authentication** | Uses IIS-level authentication (Basic, Digest, Integrated Windows Auth) |
| **Passport Authentication** | Centralized Microsoft login (paid, deprecated) |
| **None** | No authentication; application is open to all (default mode) |

### Configure Authentication in `web.config`

```xml
<system.web>
  <authentication mode="Forms" />
</system.web>
````

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Implement Authentication in ASP.NET MVC

You can implement Authentication & Authorization in several ways.

### Common Methods:

1. **Forms Authentication** (legacy method)
2. **ASP.NET Identity** (modern and flexible)

We will focus on both of these in the upcoming articles.

## üîÅ Authentication & Authorization Flow Summary

```plaintext
1. User requests a resource
2. System checks if the user is authenticated
   - If not, redirect to login page (in case of Forms Auth)
3. After successful login, the system checks authorization rules
4. If authorized => grant access
5. If not authorized => show "Access Denied"
```

# Strongly Typed Views in ASP.NET MVC Application

## Introduction
Strongly Typed Views in ASP.NET MVC provide a robust way to pass data from controllers to views while maintaining type safety. This approach is preferred over loosely typed mechanisms like ViewBag or ViewData.

## Creating Strongly Typed Views

### Controller Implementation
To create a strongly typed view, pass the model object to the `View()` method:

```csharp
using FirstMVCDemo.Models;
using System.Web.Mvc;

namespace FirstMVCDemo.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        public ActionResult Index()
        {
            EmployeeBusinessLayer employeeBL = new EmployeeBusinessLayer();
            Employee employee = employeeBL.GetEmployeeDetails(101);
            ViewBag.Header = "Employee Details";
            
            return View(employee);
        }
    }
}
```

### View Implementation
In the view, specify the model type using the `@model` directive:

```html
@model FirstMVCDemo.Models.Employee
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>Page Title</title>  
</head>
<body>
    <h2>@ViewBag.Header</h2>
    <table style="font-family:Arial">
        <tr>
            <td>Employee ID:</td>
            <td>@Model.EmployeeId</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Name:</td>
            <td>@Model.Name</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Gender:</td>
            <td>@Model.Gender</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>City:</td>
            <td>@Model.City</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Salary:</td>
            <td>@Model.Salary</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Address:</td>
            <td>@Model.Address</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</body>
</html>
```

### Key Syntax Notes:
- Use `@model` (lowercase 'm') to declare the model type
- Use `@Model` (uppercase 'M') to access model properties
- Don't terminate directives with semicolons

## Advantages of Strongly Typed Views

1. **Compile-Time Error Checking**:
   - Catches property name misspellings during compilation
   - Prevents runtime errors

2. **Intelligence Support**:
   - Provides code completion in Visual Studio
   - Shows available properties and methods

3. **Type Safety**:
   - Ensures data consistency between controller and view
   - Enables proper type checking

4. **Better Maintainability**:
   - Clear contract between view and model
   - Easier refactoring

## Passing Additional Data Without ViewBag

To avoid mixing strongly typed models with ViewBag, use a ViewModel:

```csharp
public class EmployeeViewModel
{
    public Employee Employee { get; set; }
    public string Header { get; set; }
}
```

Then in the controller:
```csharp
public ActionResult Index()
{
    var model = new EmployeeViewModel
    {
        Employee = employeeBL.GetEmployeeDetails(101),
        Header = "Employee Details"
    };
    return View(model);
}
```

And in the view:
```html
@model FirstMVCDemo.Models.EmployeeViewModel
<h2>@Model.Header</h2>
<td>@Model.Employee.Name</td>
```

## Conclusion
Strongly typed views are the recommended approach for ASP.NET MVC applications as they provide compile-time safety, better tooling support, and improved maintainability over loosely typed alternatives.

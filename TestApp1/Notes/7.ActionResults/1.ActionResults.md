# Action Results in ASP.NET MVC

## What is the Action Method in ASP.NET MVC?

All the public methods inside a Controller that respond to a URL are known as Action Methods. Key rules for action methods:

- The action method must be public.
- It cannot be overloaded.
- It cannot be static.
- `ActionResult` is the base class of all result types returned by an action method.

## What is the Action Result in ASP.NET MVC?

`ActionResult` is an abstract class and serves as the return type of action methods. Types derived from `ActionResult` include `View`, `PartialView`, `Redirect`, `Json`, `Content`, `File`, etc.

### ActionResult Class

The `ActionResult` class has one constructor and one method:

- Constructor: Initializes a new instance of the class.
- `ExecuteResult`: Processes the result of an action method. Takes a context parameter that contains information such as the Controller, HTTP content, request context, and route data.

## Why is ActionResult an Abstract Class?

Different action methods can return different types of results based on business needs. Defining the return type as `ActionResult` allows flexibility, since any derived type can be returned.

## Types of Action Results

Each action result returns a different format. Here are the main ones:

- **ViewResult** – Represents HTML and markup.
- **PartialViewResult** – Represents HTML and markup.
- **EmptyResult** – Represents no result.
- **RedirectResult** – Redirection to a new URL.
- **RedirectToActionResult** – Redirects to a specified controller and action.
- **JsonResult** – JavaScript Object Notation result, often used in AJAX.
- **JavaScriptResult** – A JavaScript script.
- **ContentResult** – A text result.
- **FileContentResult** – A downloadable file (binary).
- **FilePathResult** – A downloadable file (path).
- **FileStreamResult** – A downloadable file (stream).

Helpers allow shorthand return statements like `return View()` instead of `return new ViewResult()`.

## Example

```csharp
public ActionResult ChooseView()
{
    if (DateTime.Now.Day % 2 == 0)
    {
        return View("View1");
    }
    else
    {
        return RedirectToAction("View2");
    }
}
```

## Categorization of Action Results

### 1. Content-Returning Action Results

Return content to the browser or calling script.

- `ViewResult`
- `PartialViewResult`
- `FileResult`
- `ContentResult`
- `EmptyResult`
- `JsonResult`
- `JavaScriptResult`

### 2. Redirection Action Results

Handle redirections.

- `RedirectResult`
- `RedirectToRouteResult`
- `RedirectToActionResult`

### 3. Status Action Results

Return status codes to the browser.

- `HttpStatusCodeResult`
- `HttpUnauthorizedResult`
- `HttpNotFoundResult`

## When to Use ActionResult vs Specific Derived Types

Use a specific derived type when your method returns one result type. Use `ActionResult` when multiple result types may be returned based on conditions.

### Example with Mixed Return Types

```csharp
public ActionResult Index()
{
    if (Your_Condition)
        return View();    // returns ViewResult
    else
        return Json("Data");  // returns JsonResult
}
```

### Example with a Specific Return Type

```csharp
public JsonResult Index()
{
    return Json("Data");
}
```

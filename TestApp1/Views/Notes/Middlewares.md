In ASP.NET Core MVC, middleware is a fundamental concept that allows you to customize the request processing pipeline by adding components that can handle requests, responses, and other aspects of the application’s behavior. Here’s a concise overview of middleware in ASP.NET Core MVC:

### What is Middleware?
- **Definition**: Middleware is software that is assembled into an application pipeline to handle requests and responses. Each component can perform operations on an HTTP request or response, or pass control to the next middleware in the pipeline.

### Key Characteristics
- **Pipeline**: Middleware is executed in the order it is registered in the `Program` class. This order is crucial as it affects the behavior of the application.
- **Request/Response Handling**: Middleware can inspect, modify, or terminate HTTP requests and responses.
- **Asynchronous**: Middleware typically operates asynchronously, allowing for non-blocking operations.

### Common Middleware Components
- **Routing**: Determines how HTTP requests map to endpoint handlers.
- **Authentication**: Handles user identity verification.
- **Authorization**: Handles permissions for authenticated users.
- **Exception Handling**: Catches exceptions and returns appropriate error responses.
- **Static Files**: Serves static content like images, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- **Session Management**: Maintains user session state across requests.

### Example of Middleware Registration
Here's how you typically register middleware in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    }
    else
    {
        app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
        app.UseHsts();
    }

    app.UseHttpsRedirection();
    app.UseStaticFiles();

    app.UseRouting();

    app.UseAuthentication();
    app.UseAuthorization();

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
            name: "default",
            pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
    });
}
```

### Creating Custom Middleware
You can create custom middleware by defining a class with a specific structure:

1. **Create Middleware Class**:
   ```csharp
   public class CustomMiddleware
   {
       private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

       public CustomMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
       {
           _next = next;
       }

       public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
       {
           // Pre-processing logic here
           await _next(context); // Call the next middleware
           // Post-processing logic here
       }
   }
   ```
   
2. **Register Custom Middleware**:
   ```csharp
   public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
   {
       app.UseMiddleware<CustomMiddleware>();
   }
   ```

### Conclusion
Middleware is a powerful concept in ASP.NET Core MVC that allows developers to build flexible and maintainable web applications by composing various components. It facilitates modularization and separation of concerns, making it easier to manage cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and error handling.

### ---------------------------------- ###
1. Middleware is executed on every request in ASP.NET Core Application
2. Middleware in ASP.NET Core Controls how our application responds to HTTP requests. 
3. Middleware are assembled into an application pipeline to handle requests and reponses. 
4. It can control how our application loooks when there is an error. 
5. It is a key piece how we authenticate and authorize a user to perform specific actions. 
6. Each piece of middleware in ASP.NET Core is an object, and each piece has a very specific, focused, and limited role.
7. app.Run() -/ Method is used tu run a middleware
8. Run method doesn't execute subsequent methods. So keep run method in the end.
# Middleware defined usin app.Run will never call subsequent middleware. 
9. app.Use() -/ Allows subsequent methods to execute. 
# The Use() method places a middleware in the pipeline and allows that middleware to pass control to next item in the pipeline. 
10. Middleware has access to all requests and response.
11. Idleware is very important.

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args); -/ WebApplication is being built with the help of CreateBuilder

var app = builder.Build(); -/ Build reference is being passed in app.

Routing in ASP.NET Core is a fundamental concept that defines how requests are matched to actions in controllers. It plays a crucial role in directing incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate handling code.
Here's a concise overview of routing concepts in ASP.NET Core:
 
### 1. **Routing Basics**
- **Endpoints**: The destination for requests, usually defined in controllers or middleware. Each endpoint corresponds to a specific HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).
- **URLs**: The formation of URLs determines how routing decisions are made. ASP.NET Core uses pattern matching against the URL paths.

### 2. **Route Templates**
Route templates define the structure of a route using placeholders. For example:

```csharp
[Route("products/{id}")]
public IActionResult GetProduct(int id)
{
    // Your logic here
}
```

In this example, the `id` placeholder will match any integer value provided in the URL following `/products/`.

### 3. **Attribute Routing**
Attribute routing allows routes to be defined directly on controller actions. You can specify different patterns for HTTP verbs right inside your action methods. Example:

```csharp
[HttpGet("products")]
public IActionResult GetAllProducts()
{
    // Code to get all products
}

[HttpPost("products")]
public IActionResult CreateProduct([FromBody] Product product)
{
    // Code to create a product
}
```

### 4. **Convention-Based Routing**
In convention-based routing, you define routes globally in the `Startup.cs` file. Example:

```csharp
app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
{
    endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
        name: "default",
        pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
});
```

This sets up a default route that directs any request to the `HomeController`'s `Index` method unless specified otherwise.

### 5. **Route Constraints**
Route constraints enable you to restrict routes based on certain conditions, such as data type or specific values. Example:

```csharp
[Route("products/{id:int}")]
public IActionResult GetProduct(int id)
{
    // Only matches if id is an integer
}
```

### 6. **Route Parameters and Query Strings**
ASP.NET Core supports both route parameters and query strings to capture data from URLs. Example:

```csharp
[HttpGet("products/{id}")]
public IActionResult GetProduct(int id, string option = null)
{
    // Accessing both route parameter and query string
}
```

### 7. **Custom Route Handlers**
You can implement custom routing logic by defining your own middleware to handle requests in unique ways or creating specialized route handlers.

### 8. **Versioning Routes**
ASP.NET Core can handle versioning of APIs via routing by including version details in the route template, like:

```csharp
[Route("api/v{version:apiVersion}/products")]
public IActionResult GetProducts(ApiVersion version)
{
    // Handle versions accordingly
}
```

### Conclusion
Routing in ASP.NET Core is flexible and powerful, allowing you to create well-structured web applications and APIs. Whether you choose attribute routing for fine-grained control or convention-based routing for simplicity, you'll find that routing plays a central role in how requests are processed and responses are generated.

1. User writes URL to request somethign on browser
2. Request goes to routing.
3. Routing fethes the data from the particular method from the Controller and displays it. 


# From Browser ----(Request)------> Routing(Defined in Program.cs) --------------> Controller ---------> Model(interacts with the database)

# To Browser   <----(Response)----   View    <------------- Controller <--------- Model              

4. Routing = URL + HTTP Methods
5. Mapping is done by routing rules which are defined for the application. 
6. Can be done by adding the Routing Middleware to the request processing pipeline. 
7. ASP.NET Core Framework maps or connects the incoming Requests i.e. URLs to the Controllers action method based on the routes configured in the application.
8. Types of Routing
    Convention Based Routing
    Attribute Based Routing

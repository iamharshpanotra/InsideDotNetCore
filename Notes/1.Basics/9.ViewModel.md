# ViewModel in ASP.NET MVC

In an ASP.NET MVC application, a single model object may not contain all the data required by a view. For instance, a view may require data from multiple models or some static properties. This is where **ViewModel** comes into play.

A **ViewModel** is a special class that contains data from multiple models and additional information required for rendering a specific view. It acts as a container tailored for a view, hence the name *ViewModel*.

## Understanding ViewModel in ASP.NET MVC

Consider a webpage that displays employee details. Suppose we have:
- An **Employee** model that holds basic employee data.
- An **Address** model that holds the address details of the employee.

Additionally, the view needs some static content such as:
- Page Title
- Page Header

In this scenario, we can create a `ViewModel` called `EmployeeDetailsViewModel` which will contain:
- An instance of the `Employee` model
- An instance of the `Address` model
- Two extra properties: `PageTitle` and `PageHeader`

---

## Creating the Required Models

### `Employee.cs`

```csharp
namespace FirstMVCDemo.Models
{
    public class Employee
    {
        public int EmployeeId { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string Gender { get; set; }
        public string Department { get; set; }
        public decimal Salary { get; set; }
        public int AddressId { get; set; }
    }
}
````

### `Address.cs`

```csharp
namespace FirstMVCDemo.Models
{
    public class Address
    {
        public int AddressId { get; set; }
        public string Country { get; set; }
        public string State { get; set; }
        public string City { get; set; }
        public string Pin { get; set; }
    }
}
```

---

## Creating the ViewModel

Create a `ViewModels` folder in your project and add the following class:

### `EmployeeDetailsViewModel.cs`

```csharp
using FirstMVCDemo.Models;

namespace FirstMVCDemo.ViewModels
{
    public class EmployeeDetailsViewModel
    {
        public Employee Employee { get; set; }
        public Address Address { get; set; }
        public string PageTitle { get; set; }
        public string PageHeader { get; set; }
    }
}
```

> **Naming Tip**: While not mandatory, naming your ViewModel as `[ControllerName][ActionName]ViewModel` helps in understanding its context.

---

## Creating the Employee Controller

### `EmployeeController.cs`

```csharp
using FirstMVCDemo.ViewModels;
using FirstMVCDemo.Models;
using System.Web.Mvc;

namespace FirstMVCDemo.Controllers
{
    public class EmployeeController : Controller
    {
        public ViewResult Details()
        {
            // Employee Basic Details
            Employee employee = new Employee()
            {
                EmployeeId = 101,
                Name = "Dillip",
                Gender = "Male",
                Department = "IT",
                Salary = 10000,
                AddressId = 1001
            };

            // Employee Address
            Address address = new Address()
            {
                AddressId = 1001,
                City = "Bhubaneswar",
                State = "Odisha",
                Country = "India",
                Pin = "755019"
            };

            // Creating the ViewModel
            EmployeeDetailsViewModel employeeDetailsViewModel = new EmployeeDetailsViewModel()
            {
                Employee = employee,
                Address = address,
                PageTitle = "Employee Details Page",
                PageHeader = "Employee Details"
            };

            return View(employeeDetailsViewModel);
        }
    }
}
```

---

## Creating the Details View

Create a new folder `Employee` inside the `Views` folder and add a Razor view named `Details.cshtml`:

### `Views/Employee/Details.cshtml`

```html
@model FirstMVCDemo.ViewModels.EmployeeDetailsViewModel

@{
    Layout = null;
}

<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
    <title>@Model.PageTitle</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>@Model.PageHeader</h1>

    <div>EmployeeID : @Model.Employee.EmployeeId</div>
    <div>Name : @Model.Employee.Name</div>
    <div>Gender : @Model.Employee.Gender</div>
    <div>Department : @Model.Employee.Department</div>
    <div>Salary : @Model.Employee.Salary</div>

    <h1>Employee Address</h1>
    <div>City : @Model.Address.City</div>
    <div>State : @Model.Address.State</div>
    <div>Country : @Model.Address.Country</div>
    <div>Pin : @Model.Address.Pin</div>
</body>
</html>
```

> By using the `@model` directive, we specify the type of model the view expects. All properties of `EmployeeDetailsViewModel` are accessible via `@Model`.

---

## Running the Application

Run the application and navigate to:

```
/Employee/Details
```

You should see a page displaying:

* Employee details (from `Employee`)
* Address details (from `Address`)
* Static info (from `PageTitle` and `PageHeader`)

---

## Conclusion

ViewModels in ASP.NET MVC are incredibly useful for:

* Aggregating data from multiple sources.
* Avoiding use of `ViewBag`/`ViewData`.
* Making views more structured and strongly typed.

They promote **clean separation of concerns** and **maintainable code**.
